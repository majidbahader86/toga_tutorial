A widget is a fundamental building block in graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It's a visual element that users interact with, such as buttons, text inputs, labels, sliders, checkboxes, and more. Widgets allow users to interact with the software by providing input or receiving output in a structured and user-friendly way.

Key Concepts of Widgets:
Interaction: Widgets are designed for user interaction. For example, a button widget can be clicked to perform an action, a text input widget allows the user to type in data, and a label widget displays static text.

Container Widgets: Some widgets serve as containers that hold other widgets. These container widgets help structure the layout of a GUI. For example, a Box widget in Toga or a Frame widget in Tkinter can hold other widgets inside it, allowing you to organize them in a specific arrangement.

Events and Event Handling: Widgets are often associated with events, such as a button click, a key press, or a mouse movement. Event handlers are functions or methods that respond to these events, triggering specific actions within the application.

Styling: Widgets can usually be styled to change their appearance, such as altering the color, size, font, alignment, and other visual properties. This helps create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

Examples of Common Widgets:
Button: A clickable button that triggers an action.
Label: A non-interactive text display.
TextInput: An input field where users can enter text.
Checkbox: A box that can be checked or unchecked, often used in forms.
Slider: A control for selecting a value from a range by sliding a handle.
Widgets in Toga:
In Toga, which is a Python GUI toolkit, widgets are used to build the user interface. For example:

toga.Button("Click Me") creates a button widget with the label "Click Me".
toga.TextInput() creates a text input widget where users can type text.
toga.Box() creates a container widget that can hold other widgets, like buttons and labels.
